A question answering system that extracts answers from Wikipedia to questions posed in natural language.
Inspired by *IBM Watson* and *START*.
We are currently focused on improving the accuracy of the extracted answers.
Follow the creator's blog at [shirishkadam.com](https://www.shirishkadam.com/) for updates on progress.

## Getting Started

Elasticsearch is being used to store and index the scrapped and parsed texts from Wikipedia.
`Elasticsearch 6.X` installation guide can be found at [Elasticsearch Documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html). 
You might have to start the elasticsearch search service.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/5hirish/adam_qas.git
$ cd adam_qas
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python -m qas.adam -vv "When was linux kernel version 4.0 released ?"
```

_Note:_ The above installation downloads the best-matching default english language model for spaCy. But to improve the model's accuracy you can install other models too. Read more at [spaCy docs](https://spacy.io/usage/models).

```bash
$ python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

## Requirements

* [Python 3.X](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [Elasticsearch 6.X](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_installation.html)

Python Package dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

### Features

* Extract information from Wikipedia
* Classify questions with regular expression (default)
* Classify questions with a SVM (optional)
* Vector space model used for answer extraction
* Rank candidate answers
* Merge top 5 answers into one response

### TODO

- [x] Replace Wikipedia APIs with custom scraper
- [x] Storing extracted data in database (elasticsearch)
- [x] SQLite test input data storage
- [ ] Anaphora resolution in both questions and answers
- [ ] Machine learning query constructor rather than rule-based
- [ ] Improve vector space language model for answer extraction
