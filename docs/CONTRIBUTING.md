# CONTRIBUTING

Adam QAS is a community-maintained project and we happily accept contributions.

If you wish to add a new feature or fix a bug:

1. Check for [open issues](https://github.com/5hirish/adam_qas/issues) or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.

_Note:_ Follow [PEP8](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/) codding style.

## Running the tests

We use some external dependencies, multiple interpreters and code coverage analysis while running test suite. Our Makefile handles much of this for you as long as youâ€™re running it inside of a virtualenv:
```bash
$ pytest tests
```
Our test suite runs continuously on Travis CI with every pull request to `master`.
